COVID-19 is a pandemic affecting many countries globally.The time between exposure to COVID-19 and the moment when symptoms start is commonly around five to six days but can range from 1 – 14 days. I have gathered Covid-19 data from different sources. Dataset contains confirmed case, deaths and recovered cases, new active cases in world and in India and indian  State/UnionTerritory separately.

 * Coronavirus Analysis based on Confirmed, Dead and Recovered Patients all over World.
 * Second Analysis based on Deaths & Recovered Patient in India and its States and Union territories.
 * Analysis based on State Testing. 
 * Analysis based on Time series.

#### Conclusion: 
#######Analyze curated data related to the Covid_19 Viral Disease  to understand the magnitude of the risk posed by this infectious Disease in all Countries:
     - First cases of covid_19 is reported in Wuhan (the city where the virus originated)Central China, with a population of          over 11 million people.The city, on January 23.
     - 2-14 days represents the current official estimated range for the novel coronavirus COVID-19.
     - On January Month , the novel coronavirus cases in the UK,Russia,Sweden, Spain were reported less in number.
     - On March and April Months there is tremendous increase of Confirmed cases and Deaths Cases in all over World.
       ** Total Confirmed Case in World =3,913,644
       ** Total Deaths Case in World = 270,426
       ** Total Recovered Case in World=1,341,022	
       ** Total Confirmed Case in India = 56,342
       ** Total Deaths Case in India = 16,540
       ** Total Recovered Case in India =1,886
       (* current data reported in conclusion)
- Age and conditions of Coronavirus cases in india  reported 
TotalSamples                                          1.57851e+07
Negative                                              1.30916e+07
Positive                                                   571595
   
    
- Time series data show that their increase in confirmed cases rapidly .and also the  death rate increase in countries .

- Time Series data also show that recovered cases  more than the death cases in countries . 

- Confirmed refers to a case being reported in contrast to a case being infected. Therefore, fluctuations in days .This is       due to the sampling bias induced by the limited amount of corona test kits.
    
 -So many cases that do not yet show symptoms are tested and the mortality rate below is shown in dead per million inhabitants.
